NAME
    Log::Dispatch::DesktopNotification - Send log messages to a desktop
    notification system

SYNOPSIS
        my $notify = Log::Dispatch::DesktopNotification->new(
            name      => 'notify',
            min_level => 'debug',
            app_name  => 'MyApp',
        );

METHODS
  new
    Creates a new Log::Dispatch output that can be used to graphically
    notify a user on this system. Uses "output_class" and calls "new" on the
    returned class, passing along all arguments.

  output_class
    Returns the name of a Log::Dispatch::Output class that's suitable to
    graphically notify a user on the current system.

    On MacOS X that'll be Log::Dispatch::MacGrowl. On other systems
    Log::Dispatch::Gtk2::Notify will be returned if it's available and
    usable. Otherwise Log::Dispatch::Null will be returned.

BUGS
    Currently only supports Mac OS X and systems on which
    notification-daemon is available (most *N*Xes).
